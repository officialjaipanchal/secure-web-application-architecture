# Secure Web Application Architecture Using AWS ☁️🔐

A fully implemented and security-hardened web application architecture built on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. This project demonstrates best practices in cloud security, availability, monitoring, and compliance.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was created as part of my academic work to showcase how to **design, deploy, and secure a scalable web application** using core AWS services. The architecture supports high availability, robust encryption, role-based access control, automated backups, and continuous monitoring.
